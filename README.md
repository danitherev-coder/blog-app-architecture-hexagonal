## Blog with hexagonal architecture
## Description
This blog is a personal project developed with the goal of practicing hexagonal architecture concepts and improving code quality and scalability.
The app allows to manage users and posts by the ADMINs. 
Users who register, will be able to create blog posts, manage their account.
## **Features**
- Hexagonal architecture:** The code is organized into independent layers, which facilitates maintenance and scalability.
- Separation of responsibilities:** Business logic is separated from the user interface and infrastructure.
- **Implementation of best practices:ðŸ¤¥** Good development practices such as the use of SOLID, design patterns and refactoring have been implemented.
## **Motivation**
This project was developed in order to:
- **Practice hexagonal architecture concepts:** Implement a real project using this design pattern.
- Improve code quality:** Write clean, modular and maintainable code.
- Increase code scalability:** Develop an application that can be easily scaled to support a larger number of users and traffic.
